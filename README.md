# 16-bit-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit

**Introduction**
16 bit ALU with: two 16-bit input lines, one 1-bit input carry line, one 2-bit
opcode line, one 1-bit carry out line, and a 16-bit output line. This ALU is synthesized using Verilog and
simulated/ tested using ModelSim. The ALU performs four operations: add, subtract, bitwise XOR, and 2â€™s
complement.
